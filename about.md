Hiya. I'd love to take some time to promote a fascinating open-source project: <b>AB Street</b>.
ABStreet is a city and neighborhood simulation designed with the goal of creating neighborhoods
which are friendlier to walking, biking, and public transit. You can find it here:[abstreet](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet).

I am James Nebeker, and this is my personal blog. You'll find rantings and musings related to a
strange little corner of software development known as simulation as well as the occasional essay
on something more broad.
